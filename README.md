# Competition and Cooperation in Multiagent Systems using Reinforcement Learning

Project used to demonstrate how competition between similar agents in a multi agent Systems can lead to better overall performance. This was done by a Depp Q Learning network for each of the agents and modifying the reward function in order to provide both the overall team reward and individual rewards as well. Used the particle environment as created by Open AI in order to prove the hypothesis
